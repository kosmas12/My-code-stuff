This is my Music Player!

It is very simple at its current state, but it can do basic things. More specifically, it can play a song and pause it by holding A. A lot more improvements will come soon!

Requirements to compile on PC:

    Libraries: SDL2 library (including SDL2_mixer library)
    Compiler: GCC or clang, MinGW on Windows

    A version of nxdk with SDL_mixer (https://github.com/JayFoxRox/nxdk/tree/sdl_mixer)

Notes for changing file:
    When changing for PC, use just the file name and its path, only the file name if on the same directory as the program.
    When changing for Xbox, always use the full path
