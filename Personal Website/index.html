  <h1>A few words about me</h1>

  <p>Hello there! I am Kosmas Raptis, a 13 year old kid from Greece who
  is  interested in programming. I have a <a href="https://github.com/kosmas12/My-code-stuff">GitHub repository</a>
  where I upload code often in various programming languages, such as C and Java.
  My projects include a maths calculator and a mandelbrot set drawer
  with versions for PC and Xbox, with many more programs to come.</p>

  <p>I speak Greek, Russian and English, and I like physics, chemistry,
  maths and the related classes.</p>

  <h1>My programming background</h1>

  <p>I've been using computers for 10 years, and I played a lot of games.
  I learnt programming in 2017, many years after I wanted to learn,
  by learning Python, and later on, C++. I was making a lot of small programs,
  but I never really made something big that would require a lot of
  knowledge and thinking. The reason I started learning programming was
  because I wanted to learn how to make games. Years later,
  I still haven't made a real game on my own, but I keep learning
  new things in languages very popular in Game Development,
  like C++, C# and C for console ports of open source games.</p>

  <p>I also do a few things in the modern popular languages, like Java.
  I also know HTML and CSS (which is how I am making this site).</p>

  <p>I became interested in console development a few months ago and since then
  I have started learning C to create games for old consoles, like the Game
  Boy Advance and NES (still learning these 2) and the Original Xbox.</p>

  <h1>My skills</h1>
  <p>I can solve many computer problems on Windows and Linux.
  I also play the Bouzouki. Finally, I speak English very good, and I already
  got a Proficiency certificate from Michigan University in 2018.</p>
